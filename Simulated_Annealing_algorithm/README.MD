TSP Simulated Annealing Solver

Overview
This project implements the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to find a near-optimal solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
a classical optimization challenge. The TSP asks for the shortest possible route to visit a set of cities and return to the original city, 
touching each city exactly once. The SA algorithm simulates the process of heating and then slowly cooling a material,
applying it metaphorically to explore the solution space and escape local optima.

Features
Implementation of the Simulated Annealing optimization technique.
Customizable parameters for the SA algorithm (e.g., start temperature, cooling rate).
Examples of different city setups (e.g., square, circle, random distribution) to test the algorithm's efficacy.
